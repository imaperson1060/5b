## FAQs

### 	Don't have a Flash Player?

No problem! My mod comes bundled with a Flash Player executable so you can run it on any version of 		Windows back to XP!


### 	Want to contribute or report bugs?

Sure! I'm open to any cool suggestions, additions, or bug reports!


### 	Why does my computer call 5b a virus?

Unfortunately, I am not a big tech company that can get a security certificate. This is so scammers 			can't give a virus a certificate.
